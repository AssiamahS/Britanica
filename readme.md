Running the Application
Initialize the database:

python/init_db.py
Run the Flask application:

python/app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see your site in action.

This is a simplified example to get you started.
For a production-ready application, consider adding user authentication, more advanced frontend features, and deploying it using a web server like Gunicorn or Nginx.
